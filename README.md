<b>Dependencies</b> (pytorch and torchvision versions should depend on the system)

numpy == 1.21.5  
pytorch == 1.10.1  
torchvision == 0.11.2  
scikit-learn == 1.0.2  
matplotlib == 3.5.1  
pandas == 1.4.1

<b>To reproduce the results</b>

create and activate a virtual environment that meets the dependencies, use jupyter notebook or google colab, 
run cells in 'models.ipynb' for regression models; and run cells in 'neural network/HRI_models.ipynb' for neural networks.
